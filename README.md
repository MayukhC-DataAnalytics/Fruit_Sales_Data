Dashboard In Power Bi on Fruit Sales
Objective : To analyse sales and inventory data, providing actionable insights into customer behaviour, product performance, and overall business trends.
Data Source: The data was sourced from three Excel sheets: Sales, Product, and Customer, and was modelled in Power BI to establish relationships between these datasets.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
•	"The dashboard highlights two crucial KPIs: Total Sales (3.73K) and Total Quantity Sold (952). These metrics provide a high-level overview of the company's performance."
•	"The total sales of 3.73K represents the overall revenue generated, while the total quantity sold of 952 indicates the volume of products moved."
Customer Analysis:
•	"The 'Most Quantity Purchased By Customers' chart reveals that Amina Loo is the top customer, having purchased the highest quantity of products. This suggests a strong customer relationship and potential for further engagement."
•	"Understanding our top customers allows us to tailor marketing strategies and offer personalized promotions to enhance customer loyalty."
Product Performance:
•	"The 'Uni Price By Product Name And Category' chart shows the unit price variation across different products. We can observe that some fruits, like Asparagus, have a significantly higher unit price compared to other products."
•	"The 'Sum of Total Amount by Product Name' donut chart highlights the distribution of sales across products. Rhubarb and Asparagus are the top contributors to total sales."
•	"The 'Least Sold Products' chart identifies products like Banana and Apple as having the lowest sales quantities. This information can be used to investigate potential issues such as low demand or ineffective marketing."
•	"The 'Top 3 High Sold Products' chart shows that Rhubarb, Asparagus, and Onion are the top-performing products. This indicates strong customer preference and demand for these items."
Sales Trends:
•	"The 'Amount By Gender & Birth_Year' line chart reveals interesting trends in sales amount by gender and birth year. We can observe that female customers born in the 1960s have the highest total sales amount."
•	"This insight can be used to refine marketing strategies and target specific customer segments based on their preferences and purchasing behavior."
Scatter Chart Analysis:
•	"The 'Quantity, Total Amount, Unit Price' scatter chart provides a visual representation of the relationship between these three variables. We can observe clusters of data points, indicating different product categories or pricing strategies."
•	"For example, points with high quantity and low unit price might represent bulk purchases or discounted items."
